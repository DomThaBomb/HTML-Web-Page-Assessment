            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Tennis is a real life sport that is very much less known in the world today than when it was yesterday.
                So as the documentation as well. While we might know the game for what it is today, This website is to treat it as the source to go to 
                find information about the entire archival history of our underrated beautiful sport, the understandings of it, the people around it, the niches, and the most likely
                unknown and close to lost media news about it as well. You name it, we look for it and put it here to it to be preserved.
            </p>

            <h2>Basic Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>11th century: "jeu de paume" game of the palm - involved playing with hands</li>
                <li>15th century: Added rackets and a scoring system more complicating than math itself</li>
                <li>1873: Lawn Tennis was born. Becoming the game that we know today</li>
                <li>1877: Wimbleton is first established with it's championship. However, this was only for men at the time</li>
                <li>1884: Wimbleton would be open to women for the first time (finally)</li>
                <li>Spanning of 1990 - today: Equipment, Coaching, and Technology has had changes drastically than the from previous predecessors.
                    These subjects of changes are still being made to this day. Being that of the ball, the racket, and surfaces as well.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Basic Surface Knowledge</h2>
            <dl>
                <h3>Clay</h3>
                <dt>Red</dt>
                <dd>A red-like surface that has the higher friction in terms of movement around the court</dd>
                <dd>Ball can often kick up in certain areas due to its' high bouncing nature, making timing and technique have you hit the ball higher from your body</dd>
                <dd>the ball looses considerable amount of speed. Making topspin for the surface much more effective</dd>

                <h3>Grass</h3>
                <dt>Green</dt>
                <dd>green-like court surface that started off tennis (look back to the Basic Timeline)</dd>
                <dd>lower friction on this surface causes the ball to skid and maintain speed, oftentimes letting some of the best servers of the game get easier aces</dd>
                <dd>Following that, it allows for other tactics that are otherwise not used. Such as serve-and-volley</dd>
                
                <h3>Hardcourt</h3>
                <dt>Concrete and Asphalt (Blue)</dt>
                <dd>The most recognizable and seen surface ever</dd>
                <dd>Being made from asphalt and concrete makes this the most balanced court in terms of the speed and ball trejectories. But mostly varies from place to place</dd>
                <dd>Generally has the lowest maintenance out of Grass and Clay</dd>
